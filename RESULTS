Scripts for generating PBM/PGM images for use in eTASM.

glass.r genreates glass patterns of a given densisty
Size of image and number of dots are constants at start.
eg
    R --slave --args 0.2 c < glass.r   # clockwise
    R --slave --args 0.2 a < glass.r   # anticlockwise
as in
    genGlass.sh


RFS.r generates radial frequency search task image.
Size of image is constant at start.
eg
    R --slave --args 8 3 4 30 < RSF.r   # target is RF=3
    R --slave --args 8 4 4 30 < RSF.r   # no target, all RF=4
as in
    genRFS.sh

GDM.r generates Global Dot Motion stimuli as a series of frames.
Size of image, dots and radius is constant at start.
For some reason I ran it all in R, so no shell or usage 
(probably because I was helping Aidan with his maths at the same time).

Now with Allison (back from Jamboree!) 
Fixing up glass.r
    1 BUG - draw dot should draw if point <= DOT_SIZE^2
    2 Need to have correct screen size (pixels and cm)
    3 make image full width & height of screen (or Lawson's port)
    4 make stim 10 degrees across
    5 change task to radial (0 degrees) or concentric (90 degress) 
      not spiral (45 and 135 degrees) vs none

Fixing up GDM.r
    1-4 as for glass.r
    5 change task to what it should be :-)
    6 don't move dots that will go outside area
    7 Change genGDM.sh to make n/4 of each of 0,90,180,270 angles
    8 wrap around points that go outside radius

Screen size
    980 * 560 pixels allowing for buttons, etc.
    Approx : 18.85cm x 10.79cm.

Tasks
    GDM1
        side by side
        16 frames, 50ms == 800ms
        7 levels + one noise, random side, order
        20 trials of each
        "Which one is moving coherently?"
        So 8 sequences: 
            7 * filenames level/n.*/frame*
            1 * filenames 0/n.*/frame*
        Each signal sequence has 0,90,180,270 direction in equal numbers
        but random sample might not balance. (Ally says OK)
    GDM2
        single image
        8 frames
        which way is it moving?
        Correct is angle of direction: 0,90,180,270.
        So 29 sequences: 
            7 * filenames level_0/n.*/frame*
            7 * filenames level_90/n.*/frame*
            7 * filenames level_180/n.*/frame*
            7 * filenames level_270/n.*/frame*
            1 * filenames n/n.*/frame*

    Glass
        side by side
        single frame
        7 levels + one noise, random side, order
        20 trials of each
        "Which one is radial?"
        So 8 sequences: 
            7 * filenames level/n.*
            1 * filenames n/n.*
