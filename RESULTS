Scripts for generating PBM/PGM images for use in eTASM.

glass.r genreates glass patterns of a given densisty
Size of image and number of dots are constants at start.
eg
    R --slave --args 0.2 c < glass.r   # clockwise
    R --slave --args 0.2 a < glass.r   # anticlockwise
as in
    genGlass.sh


RFS.r generates radial frequency search task image.
Size of image is constant at start.
eg
    R --slave --args 8 3 4 30 < RSF.r   # target is RF=3
    R --slave --args 8 4 4 30 < RSF.r   # no target, all RF=4
as in
    genRFS.sh

GDM.r generates Global Dot Motion stimuli as a series of frames.
Size of image, dots and radius is constant at start.
For some reason I ran it all in R, so no shell or usage 
(probably because I was helping Aidan with his maths at the same time).

Now with Allison (back from Jamboree!) 
Fixing up glass.r
    1 BUG - draw dot should draw if point <= DOT_SIZE^2
    2 Need to have correct screen size (pixels and cm)
    3 make image full width & height of screen (or Lawson's port)
    4 make stim 10 degrees across
    5 change task to radial (0 degrees) or concentric (90 degress) 
      not spiral (45 and 135 degrees) vs none

Fixing up GDM.r
    1-4 as for glass.r
    5 change task to what it should be :-)
    6 don't move dots that will go outside area
    7 Change genGDM.sh to make n/4 of each of 0,90,180,270 angles
    8 wrap around points that go outside radius

Screen size
    980 * 560 pixels allowing for buttons, etc.
    Approx : 18.85cm x 10.79cm.

Tasks
    GDM1
        side by side
        16 frames, 50ms == 800ms
        7 levels + one noise, random side, order
        20 trials of each
        "Which one is moving coherently?"
        So 8 sequences: 
            7 * filenames level/n.*/frame*
            1 * filenames 0.00/n.*/frame*
        Each signal sequence has 0,90,180,270 direction in equal numbers
        but random sample might not balance. (Ally says OK)
    GDM2
        single image
        8 frames
        which way is it moving?
        Correct is angle of direction: 0,90,180,270.
        So 29 sequences: 
            7 * filenames level_0/n.*/frame*
            7 * filenames level_90/n.*/frame*
            7 * filenames level_180/n.*/frame*
            7 * filenames level_270/n.*/frame*
            1 * filenames n/n.*/frame*

    Glass
        side by side
        single frame
        7 levels + one noise, random side, order
        20 trials of each
        "Which one is radial?"
        So 8 sequences: 
            7 * filenames level/n.*
            1 * filenames n/n.*

    RFS
        single image
        single frames
        Does this have a target?
        So 10 sequences: 
            5 * filenames slevel/n.*
            5 * filenames nlevel/n.*

Fixing up RFS.

    The screen area is (2*560) x 980 pixels, 18.7cm x 0.7cm

    Vertical pixel height = 10.7cm / 980 = 0.01091836734693877551
                   horiz = 18.7cm / 560/2 = 0.01669642857142857142

    We want a round stim of size 1 degree at viewing distance 40cm.
    A radius of 30 pixels at 40 cm would be 
        atan2(30*0.013 (say) , 40) = 0.5 degrees 
    but stretched a little horizontally.

    I will adjust the radius so that it is always 1 degree. Hence
    it will be a little longer on "horizontal" radii (in
    pixels), and a little shorter on "vertical" radii (in pixels).

Alpha test - went shit. image gen took too long.
To do.

    Must name noise dir "noise" for AFC
    GDM single - only 8 frames
    GDM noise - fix
    Generate more images and convert to png (no root for zip)
    pad n2 to n%02d etc for RFS
    Fix size of RFS
    1 sec timing for GDM
    practice configs
    kill GDM with two stimuli
    Change GDm single image to two buttons, left and right (no up/down).
    
    *** check logs - DL to email to me.
